# Git notion and common commands

HEAD is pointing to you current working directory



### Git command
- git diff [ARG]
- git init
- git add
- git commit

### remote command, to connec to remote repository such as github/lab ... 
- git remote
- git push
- git fetch
- git pull
- git merge
- git rebase (this is also an important but less known command)
- git  

Personally, I thick such comment is important all
```bash

``` 
Make your commit line clean and linear ！！！
